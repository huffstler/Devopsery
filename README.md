# Devopsery
Scripts and stuff that I've used for the devops-y parts of my job. You might find them useful as well!

#### Be warned

Some of these won't work out of the box. You'll have to change things around, or figure out how to use the functions yourself to get it working. These scripts are a nice backbone to get started from.
