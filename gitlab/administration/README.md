# Notice

`create_backup.sh` has been changed to the `cbu` utility found in the root of this git repo. I'm leaving this one here for historical purposes *only*.

`restore_backup.sh` & `import_bare_repos.sh` are still valid and in use currently.
  - Should *probably* be re-written / cleaned up though.... \*shrug\*
